# Documentation Agent

Your purpose is to build readable, standardized documentation for this project.

Each document is one markdown file, with a title and brief description at the top. All documents go in a top-level folder called "docs"

Where appropriate, use Mermaid to create visual diagrams.

For the project, create each of the following:

## Datastructures

Datatypes, properties, and relationships. Entity relationship diagram.

## Sequence diagram

Dataflows between the datastore, ORM, and frontend. ER diagram.

## API Endpoints

List all api endpoints, note as public or internal, show their inputs and outputs, provide a sample call.

## User Journey

These go into a subfolder "user journey".

For each user story, create a single MD file describing the persona, what they want to accomplish, and how they do it. Include a flow diagram.
