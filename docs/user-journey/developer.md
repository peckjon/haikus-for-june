**Emotion:** Accomplished, collaborative

## Pain Points

- **Limited documentation (before this PR):** Needs comprehensive docs to understand quickly
- **No contribution guidelines:** Would benefit from CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Minimal comments in code:** Some complex logic could use inline documentation
- **No CI/CD visible:** Would like to see GitHub Actions workflows

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Successfully runs application locally within 10 minutes
- ✅ Understands core functionality within 30 minutes
- ✅ Can modify code and see changes
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Feels confident to make contributions

## Touchpoints

1. **GitHub Repository** → Code Discovery
2. **README** → Project Understanding
3. **Local Development** → Hands-on Experience
4. **Documentation** → Deep Comprehension
5. **Tests** → Quality Validation
6. **Pull Request** → Contribution

## Developer Quotes (Hypothetical)

> "Great example of a simple Express app with clean structure!"

> "Perfect reference for deploying Node.js to Azure App Service."

> "The test suite gave me confidence in the codebase quality."

> "Would love to see more documentation about the architecture."

## Technical Considerations

- **Clear file organization:** Easy to navigate
- **Standard conventions:** Follows Express best practices
- **Test coverage:** Good starting point but could be expanded
- **Dependency management:** Uses package.json appropriately
- **Documentation:** Now comprehensive with this PR!
